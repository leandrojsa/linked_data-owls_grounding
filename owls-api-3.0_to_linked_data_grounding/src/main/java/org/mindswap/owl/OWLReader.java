/**
 * OWL reader realize reading respectively parsing OWL ontologies (into
 * in-memory models).
 * <p>
 * If Jena is used as the backing RDF library then repeated reads of the same
 * ontology (including imported ontologies) are subject to get cached in memory
 * by default. This has an effect for situations when reading some ontology
 * fails (for some I/O related or syntactical reason): Only the first attempt
 * will end by throwing an {@link IOException} then. Subsequent attempts to
 * read the same ontology (even if it is an imported one) will end without an
 * exception and its model will be empty. However, it is possible to clear the
 * internal (but global) cache by invoking {@link #clear()}. After doing so,
 * the next attempt to read the same ontology will try to read the resource
 * from its original location, thus, throwing an exception in case of failures.
